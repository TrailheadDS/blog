I want to a series of Spatial Uncertainty.  I want to make it short and sweet and I want to cover multiple posts 

Here is the order of what I want to do

Gelman BDA3 example (Also thinking fast and slow)
Smoothing maps
Mean and Standard Deviation maps
[Spatial Relative Risk](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v039i01)
Exceedance probabilities Probability plots (RR > 1)
Qualitative Plots COVID Maps
