I began my journey early in the morning. Well not super early, I am not a morning person. I am a big fan of Whitewater, I have been there several times. It is close enough to be an easy trip while far enough to get at the more bluffy and hill parts of Minnesota. I live in the south east, south central of the state and it is mostly flat, reminiscent of Iowa. 

The trip this time however was pretty stressful. At the end of it all I was pretty happy with the distance I covered, so much satisfaction but during the hike it was pretty miserable. You see the snow just turned to ice. The weather was good but the terrain consisted of two categories:

1. Rivers of ice from hell
2. Not too deep snow that was frozen solid; You couldn't even leave a footprint in the morning

I did not suspect this at all and boy did I have at it. I fell a total of six times. Often I had to go off trail because the steep inclines and descents were just ice rivers.  So I was very slow but to be honest it was enjoyable and I didn't hurt myself; no harm, no foul.

Whitewater is beautiful. It has nice periods of evaluation and descent which lends itself to beautiful views. There are not a lot of hiking opportunities but you can find yourself there for an entire day.

No technical difficulties but I did run into another issue.  I had to double back for quite a bit of time because I dropped my USB cord while taking a picture on the river. It was the cord that connected my phone to my external battery. I ended up finding it so that made my day and I ended up climbing a fairly steep area twice, so a good workout.

Overall, it was a good hike with some a couple of snags. I would have definitely not have gone in those conditions though if I knew; it just needed to be a little warmer for the ice to melt or a little colder with the ice still being snow.

Here is a `leaflet` map with my trail. You might notice the the areas with lots of overlapping lines. That was the extra climb for the dropped USB cord

```{r, echo = FALSE}

gpx_data <- readGPX("../../gpx_data/Whitewater.gpx")
gpx_df <- gpx_data[["tracks"]][[1]][["Whitewater"]]

leaflet() %>%
 addPolylines(lng = gpx_df$lon, lat =gpx_df$lat, color = "#20c997") %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %>%
  addMarkers(lng = gpx_df$lon[1], lat =gpx_df$lat[1])
```
