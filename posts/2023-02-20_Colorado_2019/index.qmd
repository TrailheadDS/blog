I actually collected Strava data before and I even played around with mapping it. I never made a blog or anything but I collected quite a bit of data. My biggest "haul" is when I took a two week vacation to the wonderful state of Colorado. I
 haven't been there in a long time and the Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM) was having their annual convention in Denver. I ended up taking the first week for JSM and then the second week for hiking in the Rocky Mountains. 

Here is a `leaflet` map with all the different trails that I visited.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
gpx_read <- function(trail){
  gpx_data <- readGPX(paste0("../../gpx_data/Colorado_2019/",trail,".gpx"))
  gpx_df <- gpx_data[["tracks"]][[1]][[1]]
}


lake <- gpx_read("_lake")
rmnp <- gpx_read("1rmnp")
dick <- gpx_read("Dick")
hitch <- gpx_read("Hitch") 
lilly <-gpx_read("Lilly")
miller <- gpx_read("miller")
random <- gpx_read("Random")
raymond2 <- gpx_read("Raymond2")
twin_sister <- gpx_read("Twin_sister")

colors_interest <- colorRampPalette(c("red", "blue"))(9)
base_time <- as_datetime(hitch$time[1])
hitch <- mutate(hitch, relative_time = (as_datetime(time) - base_time)/60) %>%
 slice_head(n=2601) # Cut out car ride


leaflet() %>%
 addPolylines(lng = lake$lon, lat =lake$lat, color = colors_interest[1]) %>%
 addPolylines(lng = rmnp$lon, lat =rmnp$lat, color = colors_interest[2]) %>%
 addPolylines(lng = dick$lon, lat =dick$lat, color = colors_interest[3]) %>%
 addPolylines(lng = hitch$lon, lat =hitch$lat, color = colors_interest[4]) %>%
 addPolylines(lng = lilly$lon, lat =lilly$lat, color = colors_interest[5]) %>%
 addPolylines(lng = miller$lon, lat =miller$lat, color = colors_interest[6]) %>%
 addPolylines(lng = random$lon, lat =random$lat, color = colors_interest[7]) %>%
 addPolylines(lng = raymond2$lon, lat =raymond2$lat, color = colors_interest[8]) %>% 
 addPolylines(lng = twin_sister$lon, lat =twin_sister$lat, color = colors_interest[9]) %>%
 addProviderTiles(providers$OpenStreetMap) %>%
 setView(lng = -105.538, lat = 40.3068, zoom = 10)
```

Highly recommend visiting. I ended up getting an airbnb which was enjoyable but it was a bit too secluded and I had to bum rides from the host. He was a really nice guy learned a lot about him and his family. He even took me out to eat for this birthday party where I met his daughter, parents and ex-wife. 

Also got to see my friend Megan and her family. Great trip.
