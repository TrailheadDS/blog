Here is a `leaflet` map with my trail, I marked the start of when I collected data, notice it was already in the park.

```{r, echo = FALSE}

gpx_data <- readGPX("../../gpx_data/Chester_woods.gpx")
gpx_df <- gpx_data[["tracks"]][[1]][["Chester woods"]]

leaflet() %>%
 addPolylines(lng = gpx_df$lon, lat =gpx_df$lat, color = "#20c997") %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %>%
  addMarkers(lng = gpx_df$lon[1], lat =gpx_df$lat[1])
```


My hope is to have at least one hiking trip per month. Small walks in town do not count.
