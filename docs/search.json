    "text": "This is the first post in my Quarto blog. Welcome!\n\nTrailhead Data Science is the brainchild of my attempt at New Year’s Resolutions for 2023. In late 2022 I felt like I was in a bit of a slump from the COVID-19 pandemic and needed to develop some new habits. So here is the idea, hear me out. How about trying to connect a few of my passions together and create something cool? I love doing creative coding projects, I want to write more, and I want to go on more hiking trips. So what about a blog? Quarto recently came out with their new publishing system including the ability to make blogs. I love coding in R and was planning on building a blog in blogdown… eventually. Luckily, I never started so I did not have to relearn anything.\nI learned everything I needed to make a quarto blog from this page and the process was pretty much seamless, only took me about a day to get everything ready. I am currently publishing through github pages, so we will see how that goes.\nWhat should you expect from this blog?\nI have a lot of interests but I didn’t want this to be a generic “Patrick” blog so I have decided to hone in on a few topics:\n\nAll things quarto and R related to this blog and blogging in general\nMy hiking trips and love of nature and outdoors\nGIS and Spatial Statistics\n\nIn this way you can get some variety but within reason, if you were looking for Star Wars fan fiction, or musings on the philosophy of pragmatism you wil need to go elsewhere. I am hoping to be pretty formulaic when it comes to describing my hiking trips interspersed with some posts about other topics.\nFor my hiking trips I have some plans to plot some data, so stay tuned for that.\nHope you enjoy!"

    "text": "To start the New Year off right, I went hiking at Chester Woods. The weather was amazing with a good accumulation of snow on the ground. It blanketed the park and gave it this serene look and feel that you cannot get in any other season. There were several people at the park but it was not crowded at all, you found yourself on large swaths of the trail accompanied only by the subtle crunching of snow beneath your feet. Most of the trail was groomed for nordic skiing but there were some areas where snowshoes can really come in handy.\n\nTo start the ritual which I hope to do every time I go hiking I brought a phone and charger to record data. I captured my walk using the Strava app. I had some technical difficulties so the beginning of the hike was not recorded. However there was not much lost data. I ended up walking about 3h 51m and went 7.84 mi.The snow was thick so I rented a pair of snowshoes for the day.\nHere is a leaflet map with my trail, I marked the start of when I collected data, notice it was already in the park.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy hope is to have at least one hiking trip per month. Small walks in town do not count."

    "text": "I began my journey early in the morning. Well not super early, I am not a morning person. I am a big fan of Whitewater, I have been there several times. It is close enough to be an easy trip while far enough to get at the more bluffy and hill parts of Minnesota. I live in the south east, south central of the state and it is mostly flat, reminiscent of Iowa.\nThe trip this time however was pretty stressful. At the end of it all I was pretty happy with the distance I covered, so much satisfaction but during the hike it was pretty miserable. You see the snow just turned to ice. The weather was good but the terrain consisted of two categories:\n\nRivers of ice from hell\nNot too deep snow that was frozen solid; You couldn’t even leave a footprint in the morning\n\nI did not suspect this at all and boy did I have at it. I fell a total of six times. Often I had to go off trail because the steep inclines and descents were just ice rivers. So I was very slow but to be honest it was enjoyable and I didn’t hurt myself; no harm, no foul.\nWhitewater is beautiful. It has nice periods of evaluation and descent which lends itself to beautiful views. There are not a lot of hiking opportunities but you can find yourself there for an entire day.\n\nNo technical difficulties but I did run into another issue. I had to double back for quite a bit of time because I dropped my USB cord while taking a picture on the river. It was the cord that connected my phone to my external battery. I ended up finding it so that made my day and I ended up climbing a fairly steep area twice, so a good workout.\n\nOverall, it was a good hike with some a couple of snags. I would have definitely not have gone in those conditions though if I knew; it just needed to be a little warmer for the ice to melt or a little colder with the ice still being snow.\nHere is a leaflet map with my trail. You might notice the the areas with lots of overlapping lines. That was the extra climb for the dropped USB cord"

    "section": "",
    "text": "I have some news. I have decided what to write for my first series on GIS. I will still write the Strava and the hiking posts but I want to add a series of posts on drum roll please… Spatial Uncertainty.\nMaps are great visualization tools for presentation. Every one of us has looked at a map of data and made some conclusions. I asked ChatGPT, the rage nowadays, why maps are good at displaying data. This is what it said:\n\nMaps are a powerful tool for displaying data because they allow for the visualization of spatial relationships and patterns. By presenting data on a map, it becomes possible to see geographic trends and patterns that might not be apparent when viewing the data in a table or chart.\n\nPretty good for a robot, I guess? However, there is a recurring problem that I have noticed. Maps tend to display a lot of data but mostly there are describing some mean or proportion as descriptive statistics, and often they are not inferential. This can be a problem because we often make inferential conclusions when looking at these maps. We can’t help it. Furthermore, the lack of any inferences means we interpret these data with NO UNCERTAINTY!\nBut fear not! Because there are ways to display uncertainty and they are becoming more popular. I hope to give you some examples, with some code snippets and if you are interested you should try it out for yourself. There is an art and science to good map making and I suspect a creative mind will be able to distill some important statistical concepts and build something that not only looks good but is informative and allows people to make the right decisions. I did not develop anything novel here and am standing on the shoulders of giants,so I will also use this as an opportunity to link the books, articles and blogs where I found these cool things.\nI will leave you dear reader with an interesting story I have heard from multiple sources that highlight a deep problem with maps. As an aside I often don’t recommend county maps at the level of the United States after I have seen this phenomenon. They can be useful but there are a lot of issues. This story is fairly popular, I have heard in a couple of places:\n\nAndrew Gelman and others use this story to highlight motivation for hierarchial Bayesian modeling in Bayesian Data Analysis - wonderful book highly recommend\nDaniel Kahneman, the Nobel Prize winning Psychologist uses this story to highlight the “law of small numbers” in his book Thinking Fast and Slow\nThe story originates, I think, from two statisticians, Howard Wainer and Harris Zwerling, in their article Evidence That Smaller Schools Do Not Improve Student Achievement\n\nHere is the story. We want to explore the spatial variation of the incidence of kidney cancer across the United States. We have this data aggregated at the county level for a particular time period. Just in an effort to reduce the dimension of the problem we have decided to plot highest rates of cancer and the lowest rates, using a cutoff of the top 10% and bottom 10% respectively. When we do this we see an interesting pattern.\n\n\n\nHighest Rates\n from BDA3\n\n\n\nLowest Rates\n from BDA3\n\n\n\nAs you can see it looks like there is a rural pattern for both high risk and low risk. One could imagine a myriad of reasons as to why we see this in rural populations. If you are unfamilar with rural status in the United states, go to this website, where I got the title image. Kahneman details the conversation he had with the statisticians highlighting the point:\n\nThe witty statisticians Howard Wainer and Harris Zwerling, from whom I learned this example, commented, “It is both easy and tempting to infer that their low cancer rates are directly due to the clean living of the rural lifestyle—no air pollution, no water pollution, access to fresh food without additives.” This makes perfect sense. Now consider the counties in which the incidence of kidney cancer is highest. These ailing counties tend to be mostly rural, sparsely populated, and located in traditionally Republican states in the Midwest, the South, and the West. Tongue-in-cheek, Wainer and Zwerling comment: “It is easy to infer that their high cancer rates might be directly due to the poverty of the rural lifestyle—no access to good medical care, a high-fat diet, and too much alcohol, too much tobacco.” Something is wrong, of course. The rural lifestyle cannot explain both very high and very low incidence of kidney cancer.\n\nHumans are pattern seeking and it is not surprising that even the most “studious” among us are able to create a story to the data, even though we are potentially chasing noise, it could very well be a statistical artifact due to small samples sizes leading to extreme rates.\nGelman et al. says something to that effect:\n\nThe issue is sample size. Consider a county of population 1000. Kidney cancer is a rare disease, and, in any ten-year period, a county of 1000 will probably have zero kidney cancer deaths, so that it will be tied for the lowest rate in the country and will be shaded in Figure 2.7. However, there is a chance the county will have one kidney cancer death during the decade. If so, it will have a rate of 1 per 10,000 per year, which is high enough to put it in the top 10% so that it will be shaded in Figure 2.6. The Great Plains has many low-population counties, and so it is overrepresented in both maps. There is no evidence from these maps that cancer rates are particularly high there.\n\nAlthough this seems like a niche issue it is very common for unstable rates or values to dominate the attention of the map viewer. We don’t want this because you would be potentially ignoring what the data are justified in demonstrating for noise.\nSo let’s quantify some uncertainty and put it into our maps!!! See you soon."

    "title": "Intro to Shinylive",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I wanted to share a quick post on Shinylive. I recently discovered that Shinylive just got a Quarto extension allowing one to embed Shinylive applications directly into a Quarto doc. Super Awesome! You may be asking yourself: “What is Shinylive?” Well ShinyLive is a new way to make Shiny apps. Shiny apps are originally for the R programming language but Rstudio ahem sorry Posit is branching out to more languages. Quarto is another one of these branches. So anyway Posit decided to expand Shiny for the Python language hence Shiny for Python. This was announced at the last Rstudio Conference in 2022 by Joe Cheng. It is a cool expansion do not get me wrong, but I am not an avid Python user so the appeal to me wasn’t huge. I mean I know how to make shiny apps already. However that is not what caught my attention, what caught my attention was the announcement of Shinylive\nFrom the website:\n\nShiny for Python has an experimental mode called Shinylive: this is where applications can run entirely in a web browser, without the need for a separate server running Python.\n\n\nThe traditional way of deploying Shiny involves in a separate server and client: the server runs Python and Shiny, and clients connect via the web browser. Each client keeps an open websocket connection as long as they are using the application.\n\nShiny without a server? How can this be? Well it is using two technologies that you may or may not have heard of\n\nThis is all possible because of the magic of WebAssembly and Pyodide.\n\n\n\nWebAssembly (wasm) is a binary format for compiled programs that can run in a web browser at near-native speeds.\nPyodide is a port of Python and many packages, compiled to WebAssembly.\n\n\nI could go on about this but I will leave you with my first Shinylive embed for this blog. It is actually a pretty handy one. Often when I am making a leaflet map I like to have a specific zoom as well as coordinates for centering. Leaflet does pretty well so before I wasn’t bothered. Now I have a leaflet map that has a shiny slider and output which not only tells me the zoom but the lat and long of the center of the map. Pretty handy. Also to be honest this was in the gallery for Shinylive so it wasn’t too much work to get things going.\nEnjoy :)\n\n#| standalone: true\n#| viewerHeight: 1000\n\nfrom htmltools import css\nfrom shiny import App, reactive, render, ui\nfrom shinywidgets import output_widget, reactive_read, register_widget\n\nimport ipyleaflet as L\n\napp_ui = ui.page_fluid(\n    ui.div(\n        ui.input_slider(\"zoom\", \"Map zoom level\", value=12, min=1, max=18),\n        ui.output_ui(\"map_bounds\"),\n        style=css(\n            display=\"flex\", justify_content=\"center\", align_items=\"center\", gap=\"2rem\"\n        ),\n    ),\n    output_widget(\"map\"),\n)\n\n\ndef server(input, output, session):\n    # Initialize and display when the session starts (1)\n    map = L.Map(center=(42.2656, -83.5902), zoom=10, scroll_wheel_zoom=True)\n    # Add a distance scale\n    map.layout.height = '900px'\n    map.add_control(L.leaflet.ScaleControl(position=\"bottomleft\"))\n    register_widget(\"map\", map)\n\n    # When the slider changes, update the map's zoom attribute (2)\n    @reactive.Effect\n    def _():\n        map.zoom = input.zoom()\n\n    # When zooming directly on the map, update the slider's value (2 and 3)\n    @reactive.Effect\n    def _():\n        ui.update_slider(\"zoom\", value=reactive_read(map, \"zoom\"))\n\n    # Everytime the map's bounds change, update the output message (3)\n    @output\n    @render.ui\n    def map_bounds():\n        center = reactive_read(map, \"center\")\n        if len(center) == 0:\n            return\n\n        lat = round(center[0], 4)\n        lon = (center[1] + 180) % 360 - 180\n        lon = round(lon, 4)\n\n        return ui.p(f\"Latitude: {lat}\", ui.br(), f\"Longitude: {lon}\")\n\n\napp = App(app_ui, server)"

I figured this will likely be the last snowshoeing opportunity for the season so I decided to go to Nerstrand state park. It is about an hour away from where I live in the small little town of Nerstrand. When I got there I realized I have visited this park before and in the winter. It was a great walk, the snow was awesome, the snow shoes were absolutely necessary. I ended up doing quite a bit more than I expected, I was out for about 6 hours and I went a total of 11.09 miles.\n\nThe park consisted of hiking trails, and snowmobile trails. Most trails were already walked but you still got the snowshoe experience, there was only one area, really, which was completely undisturbed. It was rough not gonna lie, the sun was blazing and it was 0.9 miles.\n\nHere is the leaflet map with my trail. Not a lot of overlap, I did a little double back but that was due to not seeing the trail. I was out a bit too long, especially in the plain area with no trees. Got a bit sunburned.\nLoved it, I am glad went out there, it was a great Sunday."
