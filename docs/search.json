    "text": "This is the first post in my Quarto blog. Welcome!\n\nTrailhead Data Science is the brainchild of my attempt at New Year’s Resolutions for 2023. In late 2022 I felt like I was in a bit of a slump from the COVID-19 pandemic and needed to develop some new habits. So here is the idea, hear me out. How about trying to connect a few of my passions together and create something cool? I love doing creative coding projects, I want to write more, and I want to go on more hiking trips. So what about a blog? Quarto recently came out with their new publishing system including the ability to make blogs. I love coding in R and was planning on building a blog in blogdown… eventually. Luckily, I never started so I did not have to relearn anything.\nI learned everything I needed to make a quarto blog from this page and the process was pretty much seamless, only took me about a day to get everything ready. I am currently publishing through github pages, so we will see how that goes.\nWhat should you expect from this blog?\nI have a lot of interests but I didn’t want this to be a generic “Patrick” blog so I have decided to hone in on a few topics:\n\nAll things quarto and R related to this blog and blogging in general\nMy hiking trips and love of nature and outdoors\nGIS and Spatial Statistics\n\nIn this way you can get some variety but within reason, if you were looking for Star Wars fan fiction, or musings on the philosophy of pragmatism you wil need to go elsewhere. I am hoping to be pretty formulaic when it comes to describing my hiking trips interspersed with some posts about other topics.\nFor my hiking trips I have some plans to plot some data, so stay tuned for that.\nHope you enjoy!"

    "text": "To start the New Year off right, I went hiking at Chester Woods. The weather was amazing with a good accumulation of snow on the ground. It blanketed the park and gave it this serene look and feel that you cannot get in any other season. There were several people at the park but it was not crowded at all, you found yourself on large swaths of the trail accompanied only by the subtle crunching of snow beneath your feet. Most of the trail was groomed for nordic skiing but there were some areas where snowshoes can really come in handy.\n\nTo start the ritual which I hope to do every time I go hiking I brought a phone and charger to record data. I captured my walk using the Strava app. I had some technical difficulties so the beginning of the hike was not recorded. However there was not much lost data. I ended up walking about 3h 51m and went 7.84 mi.The snow was thick so I rented a pair of snowshoes for the day.\nHere is a leaflet map with my trail, I marked the start of when I collected data, notice it was already in the park.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy hope is to have at least one hiking trip per month. Small walks in town do not count."

    "text": "I began my journey early in the morning. Well not super early, I am not a morning person. I am a big fan of Whitewater, I have been there several times. It is close enough to be an easy trip while far enough to get at the more bluffy and hill parts of Minnesota. I live in the south east, south central of the state and it is mostly flat, reminiscent of Iowa.\nThe trip this time however was pretty stressful. At the end of it all I was pretty happy with the distance I covered, so much satisfaction but during the hike it was pretty miserable. You see the snow just turned to ice. The weather was good but the terrain consisted of two categories:\n\nRivers of ice from hell\nNot too deep snow that was frozen solid; You couldn’t even leave a footprint in the morning\n\nI did not suspect this at all and boy did I have at it. I fell a total of six times. Often I had to go off trail because the steep inclines and descents were just ice rivers. So I was very slow but to be honest it was enjoyable and I didn’t hurt myself; no harm, no foul.\nWhitewater is beautiful. It has nice periods of evaluation and descent which lends itself to beautiful views. There are not a lot of hiking opportunities but you can find yourself there for an entire day.\n\nNo technical difficulties but I did run into another issue. I had to double back for quite a bit of time because I dropped my USB cord while taking a picture on the river. It was the cord that connected my phone to my external battery. I ended up finding it so that made my day and I ended up climbing a fairly steep area twice, so a good workout.\n\nOverall, it was a good hike with some a couple of snags. I would have definitely not have gone in those conditions though if I knew; it just needed to be a little warmer for the ice to melt or a little colder with the ice still being snow.\nHere is a leaflet map with my trail. You might notice the the areas with lots of overlapping lines. That was the extra climb for the dropped USB cord"
